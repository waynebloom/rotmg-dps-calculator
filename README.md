A native Android app designed with players of the indie game "Realm of the Mad God" in mind. It provides an intuitive interface for comparing the damage-per-second output of various, user-configured sets of equipment against the various enemies of the game.

As of 12/2022, I am no longer maintaining this app and I have no plans to bring it up to date with the current state of the item system in Realm of the Mad God.
